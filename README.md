React Weather component from API
------

Created a react component using an API from OpenWeatherMap.org


TODO
----
Need to fix how the dates work.
Make sure you can search a city. (based on geolocation, then you can choose city)
REFACTOR IT FOR THE LOVE OF OH MY GOODNESS.

Styling
- General Styling. (maybe let backgroundColor change based on temps, maybe let the background of the page in general change depending on conditions.)
