#React Weather component from API

Created a react component using an API from OpenWeatherMap.org

#To try it out

To try it out clone or download this repo. Run `npm install` and then run `npm start`, open the public folder inside of the project folder, then right-click on `index.html`, select 'Open with', and select your chosen browser.


#TODO

Need to fix how the dates work.

Make sure you can search a city. (based on geolocation, then you can choose city)

REFACTOR IT FOR THE LOVE OF OH MY GOODNESS.

###Styling
- General Styling. (maybe let backgroundColor change based on temps, maybe let the background of the page in general change depending on conditions.)
