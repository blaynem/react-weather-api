#React Weather component from API

Created a react component using an API from OpenWeatherMap.org

#To try it out

To try it out clone or download this repo. Run `npm install` and then run `npm start`, open the public folder inside of the project folder, then right-click on `index.html`, select 'Open with', and select your chosen browser.

##You can change the color/size by navigating to `main.jsx` inside of the src folder.

- Replace the content after appSize or appColor with the size/color you'd like.


#TODO

REFACTOR IT FOR THE LOVE OF OH MY GOODNESS.

###Styling
- General Styling. (maybe let backgroundColor change based on temps, maybe let the background of the page in general change depending on conditions.)



###Credits

I did grab the awesome bootstrap search bars rollover feature from [here](http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/expanding-search-button-in-css). Big thanks to NoelDavies for creating it.
